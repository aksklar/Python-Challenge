# Python-Challenge
The premise of this two-part project was to utilize Python scripting in real-world situations and scenarios.

## PyBank
In this project, I was tasked to create a Python script that would analyze financial records of a company.  With the sets of budget data (given in CSV form) and Python, I was able to analyze the records and calculate the following:
* The total number of months in the dataset
* The total amount of revenue gained over the entire period
* The average change in revenue between months over the entire period
* The greatest increase in revenue over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in revenue over the entire period

## PyBoss
In this project, I was tasked to create a Python script that would be able to convert employee records to a company's new HR software system.  With the sets of employee data (given in CSV form) and Python, I was able to manipulate the data in order to create a smooth transition between softwares by:
* Splitting the Name column into seperate First Name and Last Name columns
* Re-writing the DOB data into DD/MM/YYYY format
* Re-writing the SSN data to only show the last four digits (i.e. ***-**-1234)***
* Re-writing the State data to a simple two-letter abbreviations
